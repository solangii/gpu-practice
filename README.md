> ðŸ“š Study GPU programming with CUDA and PyTorch

### GPU Mode lecture
- GPU Mode: [[Youtube Channel]](https://www.youtube.com/@GPUMODE),[[github]](https://github.com/gpu-mode/lectures), 
1. How to profile CUDA kernels in PyTorch
   - See the [profile](./profile/) directory for examples on how to use PyTorch Profiler with CUDA kernels.
2. (Todo) Getting Started with CUDA
3. (Todo) Understanding Computation and Memory Architecture
4. (Todo) Fusing PyTorch Optimizer (optimizing optimizer)

... And so on
